//DONE: Add scrolling functionality for viewing images
//DONE: Remove current pointer upon searching again
//DONE: Functional progress bar
//DONE: Show loading message after searching for route

//DONE: Remove duplicate street views before calculating headings
//DONE: Put everything back into streetviewgrabber.js, rather than being dispersed everywhere.
//DONE: Segment entire route into equidistant segments, and grab an image from each

//FRONT-END:
    //TODO: Make it possible to click and slide progress bar to move between images
    
//BACK-END:
    //TODO: Set first pointer upon load
    //TODO: Clean up code. OOP-ify stuff. Less free-floating functions that kinda grab everything from everywhere.
