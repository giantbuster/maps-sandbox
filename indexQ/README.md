If you're reading this, you're looking at the first public iteration of this project. My code hasn't quite been optimized yet, but it's on my to-do list. Also, I'm open to any more suggestions for a project name, cause I've been changing the name of this thing pretty often. You will have my utmost thanks and an internet high-five.

Thanks!
