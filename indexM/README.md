//DONE: Add scrolling functionality for viewing images
//DONE: Remove current pointer upon searching again

//FRONT-END:

//BACK-END:
    //TODO: Remove duplicate street views before calculating headings
    //TODO: Segment entire route into equidistant segments, and grab an image
    //      from each segment, rather than grabbing all images at the start
    //      of the route.
    //TODO: Set first pointer upon load
    //TODO: Clean up code. OOP-ify stuff. Less free-floating functions that kinda grab everything from everywhere.
